# 🧳 Travel Budget Planner (Streamlit)

A **Streamlit-based travel budget planner** that helps travelers quickly plan trips, split budgets across categories, generate draft itineraries, and export plans to **PDF or JSON**.  
This project extends my [TravPlan](https://github.com/Vishwa0416/TravPlan) mobile app by providing a lightweight **web companion tool**.
